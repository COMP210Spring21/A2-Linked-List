# A4-Linked-List

In this assignment your task is to complete a series of algorithms using Linked Lists. 
The tasks are divided into 3 parts, Novice, Adept, and Jedi that increase in difficulty.
Explanations of each expected output are provided above each method definition in ListAlgorithms.java.
An example of the input and expected output is also provided. For these algorithms you should NOT be creating a new list and returning it, you should only be manipulating the lists passed in as parameters. 

The list package contains the code for an implementation of a
Linked List. The Node class is how we represent a Node that makes up the
List and the LinkedList class implements all the methods of a List that are defined in List.java. Look over and understand the contents of this package before starting 
on the algorithms' solutions. 

An example of how to test your code is provided in Main.java. Since all the methods in ListAlgorithms
are static, they can be called by writing ListAlgorithms.methodName(). A toString method is provided
in LinkedList.java to display the contents of the list.
